c) Testing BellmanFordShortestPath
   Bellman-Ford Shortest Path algorithm takes in two parameters, the graph itself and the startVertex. 
   The input domain would be all possible values that the graph could take or all possible values that the startVertex could take. 
   The graph could either be null, empty, have at least one node or have more than one node. 
   The vertex could either be null or have some valid value. 

d) graph:
   B1 = null
   B2 = empty
   B3 = has one node
   B4 = has more than one node (either connected or not connected by edges)

   start vertex:
   C1 = null
   C2 = some valid value

   relation (Bellman-Ford):
   R1 = graph is null and vertex is null
   R2 = graph is empty and vertex is null
   R3 = graph has one node and there are no outgoing edges
   R4 = graph has more than one node and start vertex has no outgoing edges
   R5 = graph has more than one node and at least one outgoing edge
